ps. I include my own " Mel similarity metric " as a bonus. Helps in spotting overtraining / overfitting and mode collapses.
Metric is being displayed in the console / log and is also logged in tensorboard files.

## Mangio's fork patch features:
| Training related |

- Mangio's crepe F0/Feature extraction method
It is the best ( Not the fastest tho. ) extraction method for models that rely on clean ( No reverb, delay, harmonies, noise etc. ) or truly HQ datasets.
- Adjustable hop_length for Mangio's crepe method ( Definitely the biggest perk of using Mangio's crepe. )


Explanation on what "hop length " is, for newbies and non audio-knowledgeable people:

Adjustable hop length is like choosing between seeing tiny details or getting a bigger picture in a photo.
Zooming In: Smaller hop lengths let you see small changes in sound, like zooming in for more detail in a picture. It's detailed but takes more time to process.
Zooming Out: Larger hop lengths give a wider view of the sound, like stepping back from a picture. It's quicker for the computer but shows fewer small changes.
It's about picking how closely you want to examine the sound: up close for more details (but slower) or from a distance to see more overall (but faster).
Adjusting this helps match what you need to know with how much time you have for the analysis.


| Inference related |

- Automatic index file matching for models ( tho I can't seem to get it work on my end. It's perhaps either buggy or requires certain conditions ) 
- Auto detection of audio files in " audios " folder + a dropdown to choose 'em. ( Much easier than having to copy/paste paths to your .wav or whatever all the time )
- Formant shift mechanic; In a short, it helps " Female to Male " or " Male to female " inferences sound more natural.
- Mangio-crepe ( standard; " full " ) - Go to method.
NOTES: Speed is definitely not it's strength ( like it's the case in RMVPE ) and it's also way way more sensitive to dirty audio, however if you provide it clean audio,
magic happens. 
**( As always, for best possible results I recommend doing inferences on both RMVPE and Mangio-Crepe and just mixing the results during a song / cover mixing. )**


- Mangio-crepe-tiny ( " lite " version of mangio-crepe; " tiny " ) - Better than pm, harvest, dio but most likely worse than crepe, mangio crepe and rmvpe.
NOTE: Including it in case you wanna play around it.


| ONNX Export related |
- There's been many issues and problems with newest releases' onnx exporting so I decided to port 0618's ( RVC 0618 v2 beta release ) way of handling it.
( tl;dr, now exporting works. It exports the onnx models with onnx 14's operators.  ~ Tested having onnx 15 runtime - so the latest one available. )

I've confirmed the exported .onnx models to work with;
- my "RVC_Onnx_Infer" thingy: https://github.com/codename0og/RVC_Onnx_Infer ( and generally rvc's own original onnx inference demo ) 
- As for w-okada, nope. Shapes mismatch.
( I suppose that's pretty normal and in order to use w-okada with onnx, you gotta convert the rvc's .pth to .onnx in the w-okada itself. ) 



## RMVPE or Mangio-Crepe?
You see, each has own strenghts and weaknesses and foremostly, each serves a different purpose in a way.
Mangio-crepe is a "Crepe" modified by Mangio so we'll refer to it as Crepe in here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crepe is a mono-phonic type of extraction/estimation, meaning;
- it doesn't handle well audio which contains: layers, harmonies or any other difficulties in estimating the correct / dominant f0 path.
( results in pitch breaks, snaps, gurgly sounds etc. )


Pros:
- It tends to make the output a lil softer and smoother
( Imo it's a plus and tends to improve realism and overal smoothness + I feel like it stays more true to datasets compared to rmvpe )
- adjustable hop allows you to capture way more details than rmvpe can allow you to.
( default ish hop for mangio training and inference is 64. Rmvpe for training sits at 160 and inference is done at 512, so it's not as detail-rish as you can hopefully understand. )
- Much better handling of whispery-type of content, breathing, sighs, moans etc. Generally, " noise " type of audio data.

Cons:
- It's way more sensitive than harvest or rmvpe; It can mistake the artifacts in audio ( such as post cleanup / post uvr: instrumental residues and such alike )
- It's sound:noise detection capabilities are worse than RMVPE so, if there's too much of noise, humm etc., the extraction performance will suffer.
- Quite heavy on gpu ( vRAM )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RMVPE is a polyphonic type of extraction/estimation, meaning;
- It does handle well audio which contains: layers, harmonies or audio-elements that'd be difficult to interpret by other f0/feature methods.
( Of course, there are obvious limitations. RMVPE was made with intention of being a robust method, rather than completely replacing vocal-instru separation.)

Pros:
- It's way way lighter on GPU ( esp. vram department wise ) compared to crepe / mangio-crepe
- It's speed is no joke. Hella lightning fast.
- It tends to make the vocal / speach sharper? more uhm, perhaps, vivid/solid? It's hard to explain unless you compare the rmvpe with mangio yourself.
( same as Mangio's softness. It can be seen as a plus or minus, depending on a user and use-case. ) 

Cons:
- It is not as accurate / doesn't capture as much of details compared to mangio with hop.
- It can make breathing and such "noise" type of sounds, harsh - perhaps shallow or glitchy / funky.
- Sometimes ( not always! ) rmvpe-trained models have a metalic overlay-tone to it and using rmvpe on such models, further enhances the effect.

**Generally speaking, think of RMVPE as a method for dirty / difficult to handle / noise / instru-residues-contaminated audios,
or if you care about speed and not accuracy / details as much ( tho it is not hell - heaven difference. For untrained ears? perhaps you won't notice )**

## Bugs / Stuff that's broken or was removed due to compatibility issues ( or my lack of knowledge to fix it atm.- Feel free to hit me up if you can and wanna fix it. )
- In training tab, the " pitch guidance " where you can have it on and off is removed, it was causing issues and I have no idea how to aid it.
( It's left as "ON" by default so dw. Your model will have pitch guidance - and yes, that's what you typically want in the first place anyway )

- Multi inference / Batch inference is disabled;  broken.

- Noticed that after you unload the model from inference the " protect voiceless consonants " value becomes null.
FIX: After you unload the voice / model and then load any again, simply move the slider or input the default value: 0.33
( Now I am not sure whether it always was like that in mangio or not, been ages. )


- No other bugs or issues I've captured. In case you do and it's serious, write me a msg on discord.
PS. So far had 2 patch testers and no issues reported. Training and inferencing goes without any issues, same for formant shift.
